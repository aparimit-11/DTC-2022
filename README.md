# IAARC_VIMS_Datathon_2022

Conducted by the International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction in the summers of 2022, this Datathon required us to participate in temas in order to work towards the segmentation of construction waste based images in order to characterize different types of waste materials including Bricks, Rebars, Cementitious Debris, PVC Pipes and Plastic Wires. Using a Semantic Segementation based approach, we used several different backbones to acheive competitive results.
